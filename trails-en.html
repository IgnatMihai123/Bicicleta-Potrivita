       <h3 class="texttrails">DOWNHILL BIKES</h3>
        <p class="textintrails">
          These bikes are designed for the riders who just want to go downhill, and fast, and either have no fear or really good health insurance. They are designed for speedy steep descents, and thus their efficiency and riding style are geared toward that end. The gears are set large and high for pedaling fast over the roughest of terrains. 
          <br>The tires will be wider, and have wider rims, and the gears and frame are more durable and will hold up extremely well under pressure. These bikes will also have a chain guard to keep that chain in place on rough descents.
          <br>
          
          It is not uncommon to find up to 170mm-254mm of travel in the suspension either. They also almost all have full suspension setups.

        <h3 class="texttrails">FREERIDE BIKES </h3>
        <p class="textintrails">
          Freeride bikes are fairly similar in many respects to Downhillers. The main difference here is purpose. Freeriders have much less emphasis on weight.
         
          <br> The frame is more compact so the rider can more easily maneuver. And they are built for jumping and doing technical stunts. The frame is designed to be more flexible. They typically have around 160-180mm of travel in the suspension setup.
         
         <br>
          To put it succinctly, freeride bikes are a cross between downhill and XC bikes, but are also not fun to push up hill. The frame tubes are thick.
        </p>

        <h3 class="texttrails">ENDURO BIKES </h3>
        <p class="textintrails">
          This one does exactly what it says in the tin.All Mountain, or Enduro bikes, are very similar to XC Trail bikes, but will have stronger frames, and a bit more travel in the suspension. Most of these bike will be in the full suspension category, and will have around 140-160 mm travel in them. 
       
          <br>This is to help the rider go through harder and much more technical types of trail obstacles. These are best for taking on steeper more complicated trails.
       
          As mountain biking trail centers have become more popular, The All Mountain category are all about going up, and then coming straight back down again. As a result they are heavier, because of the sturdier frame, and are a little bit harder to pedal back up again when your done.

        <h3 class="texttrails">CROSS COUNTRY BIKES</h3>
        <p class="textintrails">
          Cross Country Mountain bikes, or XC bikes as they are commonly known, are the most common bikes most people will come across. They are also the ones you will see most of in the shops. They tend to be, generally, lightweight and designed for speed.
    
          <br>
          XC Race bikes are fast, efficient, and as lightweight as possible. They are nimble and fast to accelerate on. Typically they will have about 80-120mm of travel in the front and rear shocks to deal with the occasional boulder or pot hole.
  
          Generally they are slightly heavier than XC racers, but still not that heavy, and are built for doing pretty much everything from dirt roads to single-track trails.
        </p>

          <h3 class="texttrails">DIRT BIKES/ SLOPESTYLE </h3>
          <p class="textintrails">
            Again, these bikes are a cross breed. This time though they are a fusion between Freeride and BMX bikes. They also sometimes known as urban, or street mountain bikes. They tend to only have suspension in the front.
       
          <br>
            Put simple, Dirt Jumpers are the bike best suited for the riders who like to spend their time in the air doing aerial stunts. 
            <br>
           
            Many of these bikes will have single speed gears, only one brake, oversized handlebars, small frames, and low seat posts for stunt riding. They will also be ridden by people with no fear.
